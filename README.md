# hannibal-lecter-game
I am trying to get this Hannibal Lecter to work so here I am asking for help my question is in the README. This game isn't finished at all
so don't judge me please.

I have already made some rooms in classes and all, but now i am struggling to get the whole game work.
I made an engine class and a start method, but how do i get the player to my death class or to the next room so he can game on.
As I am playing it now it ends after the first room regardless of which option you take.
